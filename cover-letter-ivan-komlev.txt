Dear Hiring Manager,
As a versatile software developer with over 17 years of experience, I am excited to offer my expertise through remote contractor roles facilitated by my Alaska-based LLC, JoomlaBoat, LLC.
With a proven track record across various programming languages, including PHP, JavaScript, SQL, C#, C++, Python, Java, and LUA, I excel in delivering high-quality solutions on time and within budget. My proficiency in Agile and Waterfall methodologies enables me to thrive in both independent and collaborative environments.
As a non-US resident, I provide my services compliantly by contracting through my US-based LLC. I am available as an independent 1099 contractor, working remotely through my legally established business entity.
Notably, my popular Joomla! extensions, "Youtube Gallery" and "Custom Tables," demonstrate my commitment to delivering continuous enhancements and support as part of my passion for software development.
Enclosed is my resume detailing my qualifications and technical expertise. I am confident that my versatile skillset, coupled with my commitment to excellence, would be an asset to your team.
Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your success through my LLC contracting model.
Sincerely,
Ivan Komlev
