My name is Ivan, and I have 17 years of experience in web development and mobile app development.

I developed a School Management System, multiple popular extensions for Joomla, and a Custom Tables plugin for WordPress, which became a pretty popular and useful tool for website masters.

I used mostly PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, CSS and HTML5 for the Web Development. For mobile apps, I used React Native and Java, for older games LUA.

I also made a Sage50 connector in C#.

Iâ€™m looking for a full-time position where my skills will be useful.

Thank you.
