Dear [Hiring Manager's Name],

I’m an experienced software developer with over 17 years in the field, specializing in PHP, JavaScript, SQL, and related technologies. I’ve built and maintained a wide range of applications—from internal business systems to widely used open-source tools—and I’m passionate about writing clean, efficient code that solves real problems.

I’m now looking for a full-time position where I can contribute my skills, grow with a strong team, and work on meaningful projects. I’d welcome the chance to learn more about your team and how I can help.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Ivan Komlev
