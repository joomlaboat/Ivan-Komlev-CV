# Ivan Komlev - Software Development Expert | PHP, JavaScript, SQL

## Summary

I'm a passionate and experienced software developer with over 17 years in the field, building everything from school management systems to popular Joomla extensions. I work comfortably across a wide range of programming languages—PHP, JavaScript, SQL, Python, and more—and enjoy solving complex problems with clean, effective code. Whether working solo or with a team, I focus on building practical, scalable solutions that actually make users' lives easier. I’m equally at home in fast-moving Agile environments or more structured Waterfall setups, and I take pride in writing software that lasts.
